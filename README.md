Teesside University
Project Description: WEB-APP EXTENSION ON STOCK PURCHASE USING AI/DL MODELS AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS.
Client: Think Pacific
Data: **Yahoo finance Exported Real Time Data **

This work on stock buy prediction has demonstrated how important it is to evaluate historical stock data
and identify trends that could impact future price movements using the most advanced machine
learning techniques, such as combination approaches, neural networks, and regression models. By
employing predictive analytics, investors can gain valuable insights into potential investments, anticipate
market trends, and refine their trading strategies to attain optimal outcomes and deliver the possible
results in a handy way by extension, while supporting all bug-fixing, enhancements, troubleshooting
various application errors, exceptions and roadblocks in different environments and implementation of
new requirements. An intellectual artefact that could be submitted to analytics, design- own machine

Prediction of fake tweets Using Machine Learning Research Gate
Social networking sites will attract millions of users around the globe.
Internet media is becoming popular for news consumption because of its ease,
simple access and fast spreading of data takes to consume news from social media.
Fake news on social media is making an appearance that is attracting a huge
attention. This kind of situation could bring a great conflict in real time. The false
news impacts extremely negative on society, particularly in social, commercial,
political world, also on individuals. Hence detection of fake news on social media
became one of the emerging research topic and technically challenging task due to
availability of tools on social media. In this paper various machine learning
techniques are used to predict fake news on twitter data. The results shown by
using these techniques are more accurate with better performance.
